Open a command prompt
change directory to build folder of your xerte installation e.g. c:\xerte\build

at the command prompt enter

rebuildNottingham.bat (on Windows)
rebuildNottingham.sh (on Linux)

The new data.xwd file is created in the c:\xerte\modules\xerte\parent_temples\Nottingham\wizards\en-GB folder.

I look at the convert.log file in Flash Develop

Error messages are preceded with a line such as

xwd:12

which indicates the error is on line 12

sample error messages include


attributes construct error
- probably a missing space between two definitions of items
e.g. <text label="Text"type="TextArea"

correct is <text label="Text" type="TextArea"

parser error : xmlParseEntityRef: no name
- has been caused by use of "&" - solution replace with "and"

parser error : Premature end of data in tag wizard line 1
- caused by missing closing </wizard> tag.

parser error : Comment not terminated
- caused by inclusion of original --------- rather than =========

parser error : Attribute height redefined
- an attribute has been defined twice - in this example "height"

Kind regards
